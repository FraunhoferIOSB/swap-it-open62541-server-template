==========================
Open62541 Server Template
==========================

This library is part of the SWAP-IT software modules and builds on the `open62541 OPC UA SDK <https://www.open62541.org/>`_. This software module provides a set of utility functions that can
transform any open62541 based OPC UA server application into a SWAP-IT application. Consequently, the server application will be extended with an additional set ob OPC UA Objects, Variables
and Methods to interact with other SWAP-IT software modules. The software requires a custom information model which extends the Common Information Model, as well as a JSON configuration to
customize the added information model.
