Utility Functions
=================

The open62541 server template provides the following set of utility functions. To enable a simple integration, only the UA_Server_swap_it function needs
to be invoked, either at the server's start or during runtime, to make the server SWAP-IT compatible. The additional utility functions are used within the
UA_Server_swap_it function, however they can also be used separately for your individual applications.
