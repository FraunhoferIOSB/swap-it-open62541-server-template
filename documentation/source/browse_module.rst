Browse ModuleType Instance
==========================
The following functions can be used to identify single nodes within the instance of the ModuleType. However, as the Instance only features Organizes, HasComponent and HasProperty References,
Nodes that are added with different references will not be found. Since the Instance features an undetermined Namespace Index, only the Name of the QualifiedName is used for the node matching. Consequently,
BrowseNames of Nodes within the Instance must have unique BrowseNames
