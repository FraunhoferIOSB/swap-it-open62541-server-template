Information Models
==================

To configure a server for the SWAP-IT architecture, an instance of a SubType of the abstract ModuleType is required, so that a custom information model that extends the SWAP-IT Common Information Model
(https://gitlab.cc-asp.fraunhofer.de/swap/entwicklungen/swap-os-components/common-information-model) must be provided. Within this custom information model, the Services Object
of the Common Information Model's ModuleType has to be extended with a custom asset-specific OPC UA Method. To invoke this method from SWAP-IT software modules, its BrowseName must correspond
to service definition in PFDL (Production Flow Description Languge)
descriptions. Besides, the custom information model must provide a corresponding EventType as SubType of the ServiceFinishedEventType and just like with the method, the BrowseName must
be equal to the name of the PFDL service.
